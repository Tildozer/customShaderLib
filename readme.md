# Custom Shaders Library

Welcome to the Custom Shaders Library! This repository contains a collection of custom shaders that I have created or discovered.

## Getting Started

To use a custom shader, follow these steps:

1. Browse the `shaders/` directory to find the shader you want to use.
2. Add the necessary includes from the `includes/` directory to your project.

Feel free to explore and modify the shaders to suit your needs. Happy coding!

I will be adding readmes with examples of how the shaders work, the necessary includes, and recommended uniforms.
